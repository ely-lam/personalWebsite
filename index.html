            <p>Hello, my name is Rujun Yao. I have already acquired Bachelor's Degree of Computer Science from UCLA, and
                I currently pursuing Master's Degree on Computer Science at Northeastern University. Now I think I am
                well prepared to align my skill set and my knowledge with any co-op or intern position this upcoming
                summer.
                <br/><br/>
                I have practices on object-oriented principles. Combined with my passions on game development, I have
                already written more than 20 games, including a VR sky-diving stimulator and a  two-dimension
                role-playing dungeon game, In these games I tried to apply design pattern properly, such as abstract
                factory pattern, builder pattern and singleton pattern. Besides those games and projects I've practiced,
                I also has work experience in Trimble Inc. and Plato Team Inc. in San Francisco Bay Area.
                <br/><br/>
                Besides that, I have experiences on developing web applications. I have participate in developmen
                t of multiple web applications, including job search web service with recommendation systems and online
                shopping system with fulfillment system. I am familiar with both front-end development and back-end
                development. Related techniques and frameworks are including <span class="bold">HTML/CSS, JavaScript, SQL, Spring MVC,
                Java Servlet and Hibernates</span>.
                <br/><br/>
                In addition, I posses out-standing time-management skills and work well in both team-driven and independent environment. I tend to start project early to escape from the suffers of deadlines. I am a quick learner, willing to take more time and efforts on the interested field, enjoying the process of learning. I am a highly productive individual, quick to grasp essential procedures and policies, and quick to learn any valuable knowledge that is beyond the coverage of school.</p>

        <h2>My Buddy</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                I have a Ragdoll cat and her name is <span class="bold">Puffy</span>, who was born in June, 2017. She is a beautiful and lovely cat.
                Honestly speaking, Puffy is more like a dog than like a cat. She will stand right in front of the door
                and welcome me when I go back to home. She will walk elegantly and towards me and stay right beside me
                when I sit on the sofa in the living room. She will climb up to my bed in the midnight and sleep right
                beside me. She stays quiet and claim when someone is petting her... It is said that Ragdoll is named
                "cat-dog" for its good temper and the willing to interact with human beings.
                <br/><br/>
                Puffy joined me at the age of three month. At that time She was a cute little kitty. However, she also
                brings me some trouble. She used to like to bite cables, and when she arrived, she broke our internet
                cable and we are out of internet for one day. She also liked to climb. For one time she climb up our
                screen door and was stuck there, and the whole screen door is damaged and needed replacement.
                <br/><br/>
                However, as she grown up, she became more and more beautiful and more and more elegant. The only problem
                about her is that she has long hair, and her hair is every where in my apartment. It takes a long time
                for me to clean up her hair!

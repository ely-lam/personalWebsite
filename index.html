            <p>Hello, my name is Rujun Yao. I have already acquired Bachelor's Degree of Computer Science from UCLA, and I currently pursuing Master's Degree on Computer Science at Northeastern University. Now I think I am well prepared to align my skill set and my knowledge with any co-op or intern position this upcoming summer.
                <br/><br/>
                I have practices on object-oriented principles. Combined with my passions on game development, I have already written more than 20 games, including a VR sky-diving stimulator and a  two-dimension role-playing dungeon game, In these games I tried to apply design pattern properly, such as abstract factory pattern, builder pattern and singleton pattern. Besides those games and projects I've practiced, I also has work experience in Trimble Inc., which is a navigation company located in Sunnyvale. I have involved in the implementation and optimization of large-scale projects written in C++ and python. Including real-time GPS signal analyzer, enhanced visualization tools with large sized input raw data (over GBs), that increase running and testing efficiency,  and automized and optimized an existing features that co-operate several hard-ware and soft-ware pieces with multi-threads. if you'd like to know more, I'll be more than glad to go into details with you.
                <br/><br/>
                Besides that, I have experiences on developing web applications. I have participate in development of multiple web applications, including job search web service with recommendation systems and online shopping system with fulfillment system. I am familiar with both front-end development and back-end development. Related techniques and frameworks are including HTML/CSS, JavaScript, SQL, Spring MVC, Java Servlet and Hibernates.
                <br/><br/>
                In addition, I posses out-standing time-management skills and work well in both team-driven and independent environment. I tend to start project early to escape from the suffers of deadlines. I am a quick learner, willing to take more time and efforts on the interested field, enjoying the process of learning. I am a highly productive individual, quick to grasp essential procedures and policies, and quick to learn any valuable knowledge that is beyond the coverage of school.</p>
